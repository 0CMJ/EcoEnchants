  enabled: true #Enable EcoEnchants through villagers
  book-times-less-likely: 7 # Times less likely to get an enchantment from a book with a villager. Recommended to be higher as books can only have one enchantment on them.

    enabled: true # Enable reduction

obtaining:
  rarities:
    # Table Probability is the chance of getting enchantment as a percentage from an enchanting table
    # Minimum Level is the minimum xp level you have to be to get the enchantment
    # You can add more rarities by following the pattern.
    # Remember, enchantments are more likely to be high-level the closer they are to maximum-obtainable-level
    # Villager probability is the chance of a villager having this trade as a percentage. Vanilla default for all enchantments is 2.7%, however you can choose this per-rarity.
    # Loot probability is the chance of an item in a loot chest having this enchantment as a percentage
