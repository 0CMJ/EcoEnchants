# Enchantment types are like categories.
# They have a color that shows in lore, they have an optional limit
# as to how many of a certain type can be on any item, et cetera.

types:
  - id: normal # The ID of the type
    format: "&7" # The format of enchantments of this type in display
    limit: -1 # The maximum amount of enchants of this type on an item (-1 to disable)
    high-level-bias: 0 # The bias against getting high levels of enchants with this type. Between 0-1, 0 is no bias, 1 is only level 1.

  - id: curse
    format: "&c"
    limit: -1
    high-level-bias: 0

  - id: special
    format: "<gradient:#FB57EC:#EF1DEC>"
