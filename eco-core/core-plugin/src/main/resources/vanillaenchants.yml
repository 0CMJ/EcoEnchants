# Rarity option does not affect vanilla enchantments.
# The option is there for the display option to sort by rarity.

# If you enable custom max levels for a vanilla enchant you have to also specify conflicts,
# if you don't the enchantment will have no conflicts at all, and vice-versa; changing conflicts
# will require you to specify the max level.
